Stingray Karaoke offers an engaging and interactive experience for users to sing along with their favorite songs using a connected or built-in microphone.  

A standout feature of the app is its scorable songs, which include a visual pitch track of the main vocal melody that scrolls from right to left on the screen.  

This pitch track serves as a guide for users to match their singing to the correct notes and lyrics.  

The app's microphone functionality analyzes the user's voice input in real-time, comparing it to the pitch track.  

Based on the accuracy of the user's pitch relative to the track, the app provides a performance score, allowing users to see how closely they matched the original melody.
