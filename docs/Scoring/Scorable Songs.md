# Scorable Songs 

A subset of the songs in the catalog is available for the scoring feature. However, we are committed to expanding this feature and will be adding new scorable songs on a regular basis.  

Our goal is to eventually make most of the catalog available for scoring, ensuring that users have a wide variety of songs to choose from and enjoy an enriched karaoke scoring experience with their microphone. 

## Finding Scorable Songs 

All scorable songs feature a distinct star icon on their song card, making them easy to identify across any screen in the app. 

Furthermore, scorable songs are also organized into their own Scoring row on the Home screen, allowing users to browse and sort them easily. 

Similarly, the Search screen features a Scoring filter that displays scorable songs by genre, allowing users to sort and browse scorable songs by music genres. 

For scorable songs performed by users, the Top Scores category on the My Karaoke screen displays a list of their scored songs, sorted with the highest scores at the top.
