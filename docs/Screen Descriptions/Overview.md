# Overview

Most of the screens presented in this section showcase the app in a landscape form factor. While the core features remain consistent across all devices, you may notice slight variations in layout when using different form factors. These layout differences are purely visual and should not impact the functionality described.

If you encounter any behavioral discrepancies, these are likely due to the implementation of in-car safety features. For a detailed explanation of these safety features and their impact on app behavior, please refer to [**Appendix A - Safety Features**](/docs/Appendix%20A%20-%20Safety%20Features.md).
